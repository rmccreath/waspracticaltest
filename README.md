# Web Application Systems Practical Test
A Practical Test Project for GA Web App Systems

## Overview
You are to create a simple Django app that displays a list of news stories, including a heading, date and time of publication, and the story text. The news stories will be entered by a user via the admin functionality that comes for ‘free’ with Django.

## Hints
* You will probably want to create a Django model that represents a news story.
* That model will likely have three fields: a heading, the date of publication, and the text of the news story itself.
* You will also need to create a view so that these data are displayed.
* You may need to create a user account so that you can log in and add some news stories. Don’t use a password that you use in real life – you’ll need to share this with staff!
* The Polls tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/) might be useful to refer to. You can pass this test based on what’s covered in Parts 1& 2 of this tutorial. There is some useful stuff in Part 3, too, if you are aiming for a higher mark.
* See p. 39 of Tango with Django for an overview of the steps involved in creating an app.
* Check the 'Deploying Your Project' chapter in Tango for help with getting your app on to PythonAnywhere.
